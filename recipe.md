1. First put approximately 1 and a half cups of water in a pan for each noodle cake you are going to make (like if you wanted to make 2 noodle cakes then use 3 cups of water)
2. Second, put the water on the stove and boil it
3. Third, once the water is boiling, put in the spice packets (one for each noodle cake you make)
4. Fourth, put in the noodle cakes
5. Fifth, stir every now and then until noodles are fully cooked
Now enjoy!
This should all theoretically take 2 minutes to do.
